# Brightest-Region-picker
A website for picking the brighest window region from an image
The code is written using JS,HTML and CSS in which we have used Kadane's algorithm in a 2D square matrix
for identifying the region of maximum brightness.
We need to input an image , the image will be converted into a gray scale image 
then the region of maximum brightness will be identified.
